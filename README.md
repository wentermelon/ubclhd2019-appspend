# Appspend
## The Social Spending Tracker

Our entry for UBC Local Hack Day 2019 "Build Day" hackathon event is an application that allows users to track their spending habits with their friends.

For all the impulsive buyers we know, we'd like to keep track of their spending and make sure they aren't being **too** irresponsible with their money.

## Design 

For our interface, we used the HTML/CSS template provided during the Flask workshop on the day of the hackathon with some extra modifications.

### Login
The landing page for the website begins with a simple login screen for the user to access their account.

*Note: The current functionality is limited to hardcoded accounts located in accounts.json*

### Overview
After logging in, the user's current expenses are listed along with their friends' expenses in the Overview window.

Located near the bottom are the bottom are three buttons: 1) Add, 2) Remove, and 3) Log Out.
The user may **add** or **remove** expenses listed for their account using the corresponding text boxes to specify the amounts.
After updating their expenses, these updated values are reflected in accounts.json and will be saved for subsequent accesses.

The Log Out button simply logs the user out and sends them back to the landing page.

## Our Team

It was a new experience for the whole team as it was all our first Hackathon. Since we are all beginners, it was both fun and frustrating to create this project. The most important thing we learned throughout the process was to continue learning and be more prepared for the next hackathons we participate in.
